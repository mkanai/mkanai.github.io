I am an Instructor at Dr. [Ramnik Xavier](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/ramnik-xavier){:target="\_blank"} Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital & Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard University, co-advised by Drs. [Mark Daly](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/mark-daly){:target="\_blank"} and [Hilary Finucane](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/hilary-finucane){:target="\_blank"} at [the Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit](https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I received fellowships from [the Nakajima Foundation](http://www.nakajimafound.or.jp/){:target="\_blank"} and [the Masason Foundation](https://masason-foundation.org/en/){:target="\_blank"}.

As a statistical geneticist, my research focuses on understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases through cross-population fine-mapping and single-cell molecular QTL mapping. In [my current research](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.25.25340489){:target="\_blank"}, I leverage single-nucleus multiome profiling of ~10M PBMCs in FinnGen to comprehensively map caQTLs, eQTLs, and enhancer-gene links, connecting variants to function through regulatory cascades. In [my thesis project](https://nrs.harvard.edu/URN-3:HUL.INSTREPOS:37372179){:target="\_blank"}, I created a comprehensive atlas of putative causal variants from multiple large-scale biobanks to gain insights from complex trait fine-mapping across diverse populations. Prior to joining ATGU, I completed my B.S. degree in Japan, where I worked closely with Dr. [Yukinori Okada](https://genome.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/){:target="\_blank"} to study the genetics of complex traits in the Japanese population using [the BioBank Japan](https://biobankjp.org/en/){:target="\_blank"} data.
