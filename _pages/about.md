I am a Research Fellow at Dr. [Ramnik Xavier](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/ramnik-xavier){:target="\_blank"} Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital & Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Prior to joining the lab, I completed Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard University, co-advised by Drs. [Mark Daly](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/mark-daly){:target="\_blank"} and [Hilary Finucane](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/hilary-finucane){:target="\_blank"}, [the Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit](https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I received fellowships from [the Nakajima Foundation](http://www.nakajimafound.or.jp/){:target="\_blank"} and [the Masason Foundation](https://masason-foundation.org/en/){:target="\_blank"}.

As a statistical geneticist, my research focuses on cross-population analysis of complex diseases and traits to better understand their genetic architecture and diversity across multiple populations. In [my thesis project](https://nrs.harvard.edu/URN-3:HUL.INSTREPOS:37372179){:target="\_blank"}, I created a comprehensive atlas of putative causal variants from multiple large-scale biobanks to gain insights from complex trait fine-mapping across diverse populations. Prior to joining ATGU, I completed B.S. degree in Japan, where I worked closely with Dr. [Yukinori Okada](http://www.sg.med.osaka-u.ac.jp/){:target="\_blank"} to study genetics of complex traits in the Japanese population using [the BioBank Japan](https://biobankjp.org/en/){:target="\_blank"} data.
