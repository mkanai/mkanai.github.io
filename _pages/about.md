I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Dr. Ramnik Xavier Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics PhD Program](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/big/){:target="\_blank"}, Harvard Medical School. Co-advised by Drs. [Mark Daly](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/mark-daly){:target="\_blank"} and [Hilary Finucane](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/hilary-finucane){:target="\_blank"}, I am working at [the Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit](https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, Massachusetts General Hospital and affiliated with [the Medical and Population Genetics Program](https://www.broadinstitute.org/medical-population-genetics){:target="\_blank"}, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I received fellowships from [the Nakajima Foundation](http://www.nakajimafound.or.jp/){:target="\_blank"} and [the Masason Foundation](https://masason-foundation.org/en/){:target="\_blank"}.

As a statistical geneticist, my research focuses on cross-population analysis of complex diseases and traits to better understand their genetic architecture and diversity across multiple populations. In my thesis project, I create a comprehensive atlas of putative causal variants from multiple large-scale biobanks to gain insights from complex trait fine-mapping across diverse populations. Prior to joining ATGU, I completed B.S. degree in Japan, where I worked closely with Dr. [Yukinori Okada](http://www.sg.med.osaka-u.ac.jp/){:target="\_blank"} to study genetics of complex traits in the Japanese population using [the BioBank Japan](https://biobankjp.org/en/){:target="\_blank"} data.
