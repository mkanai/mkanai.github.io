abstract = {Common SNPs are predicted to collectively explain 40-50\% of phenotypic variation in human height, but identifying the specific variants and associated regions requires huge sample sizes. Here we show, using GWAS data from 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a median size of ~90 kb, covering ~21\% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of elevated density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs account for 40\% of phenotypic variance in European ancestry populations but only ~10\%-20\% in other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions, and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely explained by linkage disequilibrium and allele frequency differences within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study, the largest GWAS to date, provides an unprecedented saturated map of specific genomic regions containing the vast majority of common height-associated variants.}

title = {Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies novel ancestry-specific primary open-angle glaucoma loci and shared biology with vascular mechanisms and cell proliferation},
year = {2021},
keywords = {preprint},
abstract = {Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex eye disease characterized by progressive loss of optic nerve function that, if untreated, ultimately leads to irreversible blindness. To date, the biological mechanisms causing POAG are still unclear. There is disparity in POAG prevalence, clinical presentations, and outcomes across ancestries. Here, we aim to identify unique genetics that underlies risk to POAG and evaluate the potential connection with vascular mechanisms. We performed POAG meta-analysis across 15 biobanks that are part of the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative, with two previously published multi-ancestry analyses for a total of 1,478,037 individuals from six ancestries (46,325 cases and 1,431,712 controls). A total of 109 genome-wide significantly associated loci (p<5e-8) were identified, 18 of which were novel. Three of these novel loci are ancestry-specific, two African- specific and the third specific to northern Europeans. We also identified five sex-specific novel loci, four of which are African-specific and one European-specific. To explore biological implications underlying these variant-trait associations, we performed gene enrichment analysis, gene prioritization analysis and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) implicating genes related to vascular-related functions, blood vessels, angiogenesis, and cancer. A fifth of TWAS-prioritized genes with vascular-related and/or cell senescence/proliferation functional roles or have been implicated in vascular or neoplastic diseases are primary ciliary related genes. We further performed extensive statistical validation analysis of genes in the SIX6 and well-known CDKN2B-AS1 loci, previously implicated in POAG, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers across multiple ancestries. We found evidence of significant interaction between SIX6 rs33912345 and causal variants in chr9p21.3, with concomitant effect on expression of a primary cilia gene CDKN2A and CDKN2B at the CDKN2B-AS1 locus. Phenome-wide association analysis of POAG genetic risk burden across five biobanks and genetic correlation analysis also show the shared biology between POAG and vascular and neoplastic traits. In summary, our findings suggest that some POAG risk variants may be ancestry-specific, sex-specific, or both. Our findings further support the contribution of vascular and proliferation genes in POAG and suggest potential involvement of primary cilia in POAG pathogenesis.}

abstract = {Genetic variants within nearly 1,000 loci are known to contribute to modulation of blood lipid levels. However, the biological pathways underlying these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target discovery. To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry meta-analysis (N=1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal genes for 2,286 lipid associations by combining six gene prediction methods and assigning a confidence score. We assign, most confidently, 118 candidate causal genes and identify potential drug targets including bona-fide (PCSK9) and putative (PNLIP and ARF6) genes. Using phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of genetically-predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5\% of autosomal lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex hormones, emphasizing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism. Taken together, our findings provide insights into the mechanisms through which associated variants lead to altered lipid levels and potentially cardiovascular disease risk.}

abstract = {A major challenge of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is to translate phenotypic associations into biological insights. Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations, and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels, and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence. Two prioritized genes, CREBRF and RRBP1, show convergent evidence across functional datasets supporting their roles in lipid biology.}

abstract = {Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of cardiovascular disease with varied prevalence worldwide owing to different dietary patterns and medication use1. Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide3. Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS4--23 have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from 7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable26 application of polygenic scores in clinical practice. A genome-wide association meta-analysis study of blood lipid levels in roughly 1.6 million individuals demonstrates the gain of power attained when diverse ancestries are included to improve fine-mapping and polygenic score generation, with gains in locus discovery related to sample size.},

title = {Multi-ancestry meta-analysis of asthma identifies novel associations and highlights the value of increased power and diversity},
year = {2021},
keywords = {preprint},
abstract = {Asthma is a complex disease that affects millions of people and varies in prevalence by an order of magnitude across geographic regions and populations. However, the extent to which genetic variation contributes to these disparities is unclear, as studies probing the genetics of asthma have been primarily limited to populations of European (EUR) descent. As part of the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI), we conducted the largest genome-wide association study of asthma to date (153,763 cases and 1,647,022 controls) via meta-analysis across 18 biobanks spanning multiple countries and ancestries. Altogether, we discovered 180 genome-wide significant loci (p -8) associated with asthma, 49 of which are not previously reported. We replicate well-known associations such as IL1RL1 and STAT6, and find that overall the novel associations have smaller effects than previously-discovered loci, highlighting our substantial increase in statistical power. Despite the considerable range in prevalence among biobanks, from 3\% to 24\%, the genetic effects of associated loci are largely consistent across the biobanks and ancestries. To further investigate the polygenic architecture of asthma, we construct polygenic risk scores (PRS) using a multi-ancestry approach, which yields higher predictive power for asthma in non-EUR populations compared to PRS derived from previous asthma meta-analyses and using other methods. Additionally, we find considerable genetic overlap between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) across ancestries but minimal overlap in enriched biological pathways. Our work underscores the multifactorial nature of asthma development and offers insight into the shared genetic architecture of asthma that may be differentially perturbed by environmental factors and contribute to variation in prevalence.}

abstract = {The Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI), through its genetic and demographic diversity, provides a valuable opportunity to study population-wide and ancestry-specific genetic associations. However, with multiple ascertainment strategies and multi-ethnic study populations across biobanks, the GBMI provides a distinct set of challenges in implementing statistical genetics methods. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are a popular tool to boost detection power for and provide biological context to genetic associations by integrating single nucleotide polymorphism to trait (SNP-trait) associations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with SNP-based predictive models of gene expression. TWAS presents unique challenges beyond GWAS, especially in a multi-biobank and meta-analytic setting like the GBMI. In this work, we present the GBMI TWAS pipeline, outlining practical considerations for ancestry and tissue specificity and meta-analytic strategies, as well as open challenges at every step of the framework. Our work provides a strong foundation for adding tissue-specific gene expression context to biobank-linked genetic association studies, allowing for ancestry-aware discovery to accelerate genomic medicine.}

abstract = {With the increasing availability of biobank-scale datasets that incorporate both genomic data and electronic health records, many associations between genetic variants and phenotypes of interest have been discovered. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are being widely explored in precision medicine, use the results of association studies to predict the genetic component of disease risk by accumulating risk alleles weighted by their effect sizes. However, limited studies have thoroughly investigated best practices for PRS in global populations across different diseases. In this study, we utilize data from the Global-Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI), which consists of individuals from diverse ancestries and across continents, to explore methodological considerations and PRS prediction performance in 9 different biobanks for 14 disease endpoints. Specifically, we constructed PRS using heuristic (pruning and thresholding, P+T) and Bayesian (PRS-CS) methods. We found that the genetic architecture, such as SNP-based heritability and polygenicity, varied greatly among endpoints. For both PRS construction methods, using a European ancestry LD reference panel resulted in comparable or higher prediction accuracy compared to several other non-European based panels; this is largely attributable to European descent populations still comprising the majority of GBMI participants. PRS-CS overall outperformed the classic P+T method, especially for endpoints with higher SNP-based heritability. For example, substantial improvements are observed in East-Asian ancestry (EAS) using PRS-CS compared to P+T for heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Notably, prediction accuracy is heterogeneous across endpoints, biobanks, and ancestries, especially for asthma which has known variation in disease prevalence across global populations. Overall, we provide lessons for PRS construction, evaluation, and interpretation using the GBMI and highlight the importance of best practices for PRS in the biobank-scale genomics era.}

abstract = {Biobanks are being established across the world to understand the genetic, environmental, and epidemiological basis of human diseases with the goal of better prevention and treatments. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been very successful at mapping genomic loci for a wide range of human diseases and traits, but in general, lack appropriate representation of diverse ancestries - with most biobanks and preceding GWAS studies composed of individuals of European ancestries. Here, we introduce the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) -- a collaborative network of 19 biobanks from 4 continents representing more than 2.1 million consented individuals with genetic data linked to electronic health records. GBMI meta-analyzes summary statistics from GWAS generated using harmonized genotypes and phenotypes from member biobanks. GBMI brings together results from GWAS analysis across 6 main ancestry groups: approximately 33,000 of African ancestry either from Africa or from admixed-ancestry diaspora (AFR), 18,000 admixed American (AMR), 31,000 Central and South Asian (CSA), 341,000 East Asian (EAS), 1.4 million European (EUR), and 1,600 Middle Eastern (MID) individuals. In this flagship project, we generated GWASs from across 14 exemplar diseases and endpoints, including both common and less prevalent diseases that were previously understudied. Using the genetic association results, we validate that GWASs conducted in biobanks worldwide can be successfully integrated despite heterogeneity in case definitions, recruitment strategies, and baseline characteristics between biobanks. We demonstrate the value of this collaborative effort to improve GWAS power for diseases, increase representation, benefit understudied diseases, and improve risk prediction while also enabling the nomination of disease genes and drug candidates by incorporating gene and protein expression data and providing insight into the underlying biology of the studied traits.},

However, these must be weighed against the potential risks, such as uncertainties and biases in PRS performance, as well as potential misunderstanding and misuse of these within medical practice and in wider society. By addressing key issues including gaps in best practices, risk communication and regulatory frameworks, PRSs can be used responsibly to improve human health.

Of these, we found 285 high-confidence variant-trait pairs replicated across multiple populations, and we characterized multiple contributors to the surprising lack of overlap among fine-mapping results from different biobanks. By studying the bottlenecked Finnish and Japanese populations, we identified 21 and 26 putative causal coding variants with extreme allele frequency enrichment (> 10-fold) in these two populations, respectively. Aggregating data across populations enabled identification of 1,492 unique fine-mapped coding variants and 176 genes in which multiple independent coding variants influence the same trait (i.e., with an allelic series of coding variants). Our results demonstrate that fine-mapping in diverse populations enables novel insights into the biology of complex traits by pinpointing high-confidence causal variants for further characterization.},

Our study suggests a potential avenue for hypothesis-free re-investigation of human diseases through genetics.

MPRAu expands our understanding of 3'UTR function, suggesting that simple sequences predominately explain 3'UTR regulatory activity.

Dominance effects are well documented in model organisms. However, evidence in humans is limited to a handful of traits, particularly those with strong single locus effects such as hair color. We carried out the largest systematic evaluation of dominance effects on phenotypic variance in the UK Biobank. We curated and tested over 1,000 phenotypes for dominance effects through GWAS scans, identifying 175 loci at genome-wide significance correcting for multiple testing (P 0.05), we found no strong evidence of a contribution to phenotypic variance when accounting for multiple testing. Across the 267 continuous and 793 binary traits the median contribution was 5.73 $\times$ 10-4, with unbiased point estimates ranging from -0.261 to 0.131. Finally, we introduce dominance fine-mapping to explore whether the more rapid decay of dominance LD can be leveraged to find causal variants. These results provide the most comprehensive assessment of dominance trait variation in humans to date.}

abstract = {The genetic makeup of an individual contributes to susceptibility and response to viral infection. While environmental, clinical and social factors play a role in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease severity1,2, host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors may reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprised of up to 49,562 COVID-19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries. We reported 13 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases3--7. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. Mendelian Randomization analyses support a causal role for smoking and body mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19, with unprecedented speed, was made possible by the community of human genetic researchers coming together to prioritize sharing of data, results, resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international collaboration underscores what is possible for future genetic discoveries in emerging pandemics, or indeed for any complex human disease.},

year = {2021},
keywords = {preprint},
abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of premature death and disability worldwide, with both genetic and environmental determinants. While genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic loci associated with cardiovascular diseases, exact genes driving these associations remain mostly uncovered. Due to Finland's population history, many deleterious and high-impact variants are enriched in the Finnish population giving a possibility to find genetic associations for protein-truncating variants that likely tie the association to a gene and that would not be detected elsewhere. In FinnGen, a large Finnish biobank study, we identified an inframe insertion rs534125149 in MFGE8 to have protective effect against coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.75, p = 2.63E-16) and related endpoints. This variant is highly enriched in Finland (70-fold compared to Non-Finnish Europeans) with allele frequency of 3\% in Finland. The protective association was replicated in meta-analysis of biobanks of Japan and Estonian (OR = 0.75, p = 5.41E-7). Additionally, we identified a splice acceptor variant rs201988637 in MFGE8, independent of the rs534125149 and similarly protective in relation to coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.72, p = 7.94E-06) and related endpoints, with no significant risk-increasing associations. The protein-truncating variant was also associated with lower pulse pressure, pointing towards a function of MFGE8 in arterial stiffness and aging also in humans in addition to previous evidence in mice. In conclusion, our results show that inhibiting the production of lactadherin could lower the risk for coronary heart disease substantially.}

volume = {12},

abstract = {The large majority of variants identified by GWAS are non-coding, motivating detailed characterization of the function of non-coding variants. Experimental methods to assess variants' effect on gene expressions in native chromatin context via direct perturbation are low-throughput. Existing high-throughput computational predictors thus have lacked large gold standard sets of regulatory variants for training and validation. Here, we leverage a set of 14,807 putative causal eQTLs in humans obtained through statistical fine-mapping, and we use 6121 features to directly train a predictor of whether a variant modifies nearby gene expression. We call the resulting prediction the expression modifier score (EMS). We validate EMS by comparing its ability to prioritize functional variants with other major scores. We then use EMS as a prior for statistical fine-mapping of eQTLs to identify an additional 20,913 putatively causal eQTLs, and we incorporate EMS into co-localization analysis to identify 310 additional candidate genes across UK Biobank phenotypes. Finding causal variants and genes from GWAS loci results remains a challenge. Here, the authors train a model to predict if a variant affects nearby gene expression, and apply the method to identify new possible causal eQTLs and mechanisms of GWAS loci.},

Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of COVID-19 in a Japanese population led by the Japan COVID-19 Task Force, as one of the initial discovery GWAS studies performed on a non-European population. Enrolling a total of 2,393 cases and 3,289 controls, we not only replicated previously reported COVID-19 risk variants (e.g., LZTFL1, FOXP4, ABO, and IFNAR2), but also found a variant on 5p35 (rs60200309-A at DOCK2) that was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 in younger (<65 years of age) patients with a genome-wide significant p-value of 1.2 × 10-8) (odds ratio = 2.01, 95\% confidence interval = 1.58-2.55). This risk allele was prevalent in East Asians, including Japanese (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.097), but rarely found in Europeans. Cross-population Mendelian randomization analysis made a causal inference of a number of complex human traits on COVID-19. In particular, obesity had a significant impact on severe COVID-19. The presence of the population-specific risk allele underscores the need of non-European studies of COVID-19 host genetics.}

abstract = {Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease with poor prognosis. By contrast, cancer is common in any elderly population and a leading killer, but is now often curable. Of note, whereas IPF is driven by cellular senescence, cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division. Using data available from two large biobank-based studies (Finnish FinnGen study and UK biobank), we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the shared genetic background of IPF and cancer. In a population sample of 218,792 Finns with complete longitudinal health histories, we estimated the effect of individual genetic variants to the lifetime risk of IPF and cancer. We extend the analysis from IPF-GWAS to pan-cancer meta-analysis over FinnGen and UK Biobank and finally to the identification of genetic drivers of somatic chromosomal alterations. We detected six loci (SPDL1, MAD1L1, MAP2K1, RTEL1-STMN3, TERC-ACTRT3, OBFC1) associated with both IPF and cancer, all closely related to cellular division. However, each individual signal is found with opposite effects over the two diseases, termed as antagonistic pleiotropy. Several of these loci (TERC-ACTRT3, RTEL1-STMN3, OBFC1) are among the strongest inherited factors for constitutive telomere length variation and consistently indicate that shorter telomere length would increase the risk for IPF but protect from malignancy. However, a Finnish enriched SPDL1 missense variant and a common MAD1L1 intronic variant had no effect on telomere length but were shown to protect individuals from accumulation of somatic mutations. The decreased risk of cancer in SPDL1 and MAD1L1 variant carriers might result from a lower number of chromosomal alterations accumulated over time, conversely leading to fibrosis in the lung due to cellular senescence-induced inflammation. We hypothesize that the SPDL1 missense variant functions as gain-of-function mutation, leading to cellular senescence, a barrier to cancer and a driver of fibrosis in IPF. If translated to therapy, these findings might not only be able to offer relief to individuals with IPF, but also to protect from onset of cancer.}

abstract = {Genetic association results are often interpreted with the assumption that study participation does not affect downstream analyses. Understanding the genetic basis of participation bias is challenging since it requires the genotypes of unseen individuals. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate comparative biases by performing a genome-wide association study contrasting one subgroup versus another. For example, we showed that sex exhibits artifactual autosomal heritability in the presence of sex-differential participation bias. By performing a genome-wide association study of sex in approximately 3.3 million males and females, we identified over 158 autosomal loci spuriously associated with sex and highlighted complex traits underpinning differences in study participation between the sexes. For example, the body mass index-increasing allele at FTO was observed at higher frequency in males compared to females (odds ratio = 1.02, P = 4.4 $\times$ 10-36). Finally, we demonstrated how these biases can potentially lead to incorrect inferences in downstream analyses and propose a conceptual framework for addressing such biases. Our findings highlight a new challenge that genetic studies may face as sample sizes continue to grow.},

abstract = {Many diseases exhibit population-specific causal effect sizes with trans-ethnic genetic correlations significantly less than 1, limiting trans-ethnic polygenic risk prediction. We develop a new method, S-LDXR, for stratifying squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation across genomic annotations, and apply S-LDXR to genome-wide summary statistics for 31 diseases and complex traits in East Asians (average N = 90K) and Europeans (average N = 267K) with an average trans-ethnic genetic correlation of 0.85. We determine that squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation is 0.82$\times$ (s.e. 0.01) depleted in the top quintile of background selection statistic, implying more population-specific causal effect sizes. Accordingly, causal effect sizes are more population-specific in functionally important regions, including conserved and regulatory regions. In regions surrounding specifically expressed genes, causal effect sizes are most population-specific for skin and immune genes, and least population-specific for brain genes. Our results could potentially be explained by stronger gene-environment interaction at loci impacted by selection, particularly positive selection.},

abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on European training data suffer reduced accuracy in non-European target populations, exacerbating health disparities. This loss of accuracy predominantly stems from LD differences, MAF differences (including population-specific SNPs), and/or causal effect size differences. Here, we propose PolyPred, a method that improves trans-ethnic polygenic prediction by combining two complementary predictors: a new predictor that leverages functionally informed fine-mapping to estimate causal effects (instead of tagging effects), addressing LD differences; and BOLT-LMM, a published predictor. In the special case where a large training sample is available in the non-European target population (or a closely related population), we propose PolyPred+, which further incorporates the non-European training data, addressing MAF differences and causal effect size differences. We applied PolyPred to 49 diseases and complex traits in 4 UK Biobank populations using UK Biobank British training data (averageN=325K), and observed statistically significant average relative improvements in prediction accuracy vs. BOLT-LMM ranging from +7\% in South Asians to +32\% in Africans (and vs. LD-pruning + P-value thresholding (P+T) ranging from +77\% to +164\%), consistent with simulations. We applied PolyPred+ to 23 diseases and complex traits in UK Biobank East Asians using both UK Biobank British (averageN=325K) and Biobank Japan (averageN=124K) training data, and observed statistically significant average relative improvements in prediction accuracy of +24\% vs. BOLT-LMM and +12\% vs. PolyPred. In conclusion, PolyPred and PolyPred+ improve trans-ethnic polygenic prediction accuracy, ameliorating health disparities.},

year = {2020},
keywords = {preprint},
abstract = {Otosclerosis is one of the most common causes of conductive hearing loss, affecting 0.3\% of the population. It typically presents in adulthood and half of the patients have a positive family history. The pathophysiology of otosclerosis is poorly understood and treatment options are limited. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a single association locus in an intronic region of RELN . Here, we report a meta-analysis of GWAS studies of otosclerosis in three population-based biobanks comprising 2,413 cases and 762,382 controls. We identify 15 novel risk loci (p < 5*10−8) and replicate the regions of RELN and two previously reported candidate genes (TGFB1 and MEPE). Implicated genes in many loci are essential for bone remodelling or mineralization. Otosclerosis is genetically correlated with height and fracture risk, and the association loci overlap with severe skeletal disorders. Our results highlight TGFβ1 signalling for follow-up mechanistic studies.}

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a valuable tool for understanding the biology of complex traits, but the associations found rarely point directly to causal genes. Here, we introduce a new method to identify the causal genes by integrating GWAS summary statistics with gene expression, biological pathway, and predicted protein-protein interaction data. We further propose an approach that effectively leverages both polygenic and locus-specific genetic signals by combining results across multiple gene prioritization methods, increasing confidence in prioritized genes. Using a large set of gold standard genes to evaluate our approach, we prioritize 8,402 unique gene-trait pairs with greater than 75\% estimated precision across 113 complex traits and diseases, including known genes such as SORT1 for LDL cholesterol, SMIM1 for red blood cell count, and DRD2 for schizophrenia, as well as novel genes such as TTC39B for cholelithiasis. Our results demonstrate that a polygenic approach is a powerful tool for gene prioritization and, in combination with locus-specific signal, improves upon existing methods.},

We also identified 28 additional novel variants in ancestry-specific, non-EUR meta-analyses, including an IL7 missense variant in South Asians associated with lymphocyte count in vivo and IL-7 secretion levels in vitro. Fine-mapping prioritized variants annotated as functional and generated 95\% credible sets that were 30\% smaller when using the trans-ethnic as opposed to the EUR-only results. We explored the clinical significance and predictive value of trans-ethnic variants in multiple populations and compared genetic architecture and the effect of natural selection on these blood phenotypes between populations.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The genetic background of rheumatoid arthritis-interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) has been evaluated in Europeans, but little knowledge has been obtained in non-Europeans. This study aimed to elucidate genome-wide risk of RA-ILD in non-Europeans. METHODS: We performed an initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) of RA-ILD in the Japanese population. By conducting the meta-analysis of the three GWAS datasets of the RA cohorts and biobank of Japanese, our study included 358 RA-ILD cases and 4550 RA subjects without ILD. We then conducted the stratified analysis of the effect of the GWAS risk allele in each CT image pattern. RESULTS: We identified one novel RA-ILD risk locus at 7p21 that satisfied the genome-wide significance threshold (rs12702634 at RPA3-UMAD1, OR=2.04, 95\% CI 1.59 to 2.60, p=1.5$\times$10-8). Subsequent stratified analysis based on the CT image patterns demonstrated that the effect size of the RA-ILD risk allele (rs12702634-C) was large with the UIP pattern (OR=1.86, 95\% CI 0.97 to 3.58, p=0.062) and the probable UIP pattern (OR=2.26, 95\% CI 1.36 to 3.73, p=0.0015). CONCLUSION: We revealed one novel genetic association with RA-ILD in Japanese. The RA-ILD risk of the identified variant at RPA3-UMAD1 was relatively high in the CT image patterns related to fibrosis. Our study should contribute to elucidation of the complicated aetiology of RA-ILD.},

abstract = {The diversity in our genome is crucial to understanding the demographic history of worldwide populations. However, we have yet to know whether subtle genetic differences within a population can be disentangled, or whether they have an impact on complex traits. Here we apply dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE, PCA-t-SNE, UMAP, and PCA-UMAP) to biobank-derived genomic data of a Japanese population (n = 169,719). Dimensionality reduction reveals fine-scale population structure, conspicuously differentiating adjacent insular subpopulations. We further enluciate the demographic landscape of these Japanese subpopulations using population genetics analyses. Finally, we perform phenome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses on 67 complex traits. Differences in PRS between the deconvoluted subpopulations are not always concordant with those in the observed phenotypes, suggesting that the PRS differences might reflect biases from the uncorrected structure, in a trait-dependent manner. This study suggests that such an uncorrected structure can be a potential pitfall in the clinical application of PRS.},

To this end, we investigated the association of the genetic susceptibility to complex traits with human lifespan in collaboration with three worldwide biobanks (ntotal = 675,898; BioBank Japan (n = 179,066), UK Biobank (n = 361,194) and FinnGen (n = 135,638)). In contrast to observational studies, in which discerning the cause-and-effect can be difficult, PRSs could help to identify the driver biomarkers affecting human lifespan. A high systolic blood pressure PRS was trans-ethnically associated with a shorter lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.03[1.02-1.04], Pmeta = 3.9 $\times$ 10-13) and parental lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.06[1.06-1.07], P = 2.0 $\times$ 10-86). The obesity PRS showed distinct effects on lifespan in Japanese and European individuals (Pheterogeneity = 9.5 $\times$ 10-8 for BMI). The causal effect of blood pressure and obesity on lifespan was further supported by Mendelian randomization studies. Beyond genotype-phenotype associations, our trans-biobank study offers a new value of PRSs in prioritization of risk factors that could be potential targets of medical treatment to improve population health.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have associated thousands of genetic variants with complex traits and diseases, but pinpointing the causal variant(s) among those in tight linkage disequilibrium with each associated variant remains a major challenge. Here, we use seven experimental assays to characterize all common variants at the multiple disease-associated TNFAIP3 locus in five disease-relevant immune cell lines, based on a set of features related to regulatory potential. Trait/disease-associated variants are enriched among SNPs prioritized based on either: (1) residing within CRISPRi-sensitive regulatory regions, or (2) localizing in a chromatin accessible region while displaying allele-specific reporter activity. Of the 15 trait/disease-associated haplotypes at TNFAIP3, 9 have at least one variant meeting one or both of these criteria, 5 of which are further supported by genetic fine-mapping. Our work provides a comprehensive strategy to characterize genetic variation at important disease-associated loci, and aids in the effort to identify trait causal genetic variants.},

abstract = {Dietary habits are important factors in our lifestyle, and confer both susceptibility to and protection from a variety of human diseases. We performed genome-wide association studies for 13 dietary habits including consumption of alcohol (ever versus never drinkers and drinks per week), beverages (coffee, green tea and milk) and foods (yoghurt, cheese, natto, tofu, fish, small whole fish, vegetables and meat) in Japanese individuals (n = 58,610-165,084) collected by BioBank Japan, the nationwide hospital-based genome cohort. Significant associations were found in nine genetic loci (MCL1-ENSA, GCKR, AGR3-AHR, ADH1B, ALDH1B1, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, CYP1A2-CSK and ADORA2A-AS1) for 13 dietary traits (P < 3.8 $\times$ 10-9). Of these, ten associations between five loci and eight traits were new findings. Furthermore, a phenome-wide association study revealed that five of the dietary trait-associated loci have pleiotropic effects on multiple human complex diseases and clinical measurements. Our findings provide new insight into the genetics of habitual consumption.},

abstract = {In many species, the offspring of related parents suffer reduced reproductive success, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that FROH is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55\% decrease [95\% CI 44-66\%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of FROH are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in FROH is independent of all environmental confounding.},

year = {2019},
abstract = {Rare genetic variants can cause epilepsy, and genetic testing has been widely adopted for severe, paediatric-onset epilepsies. The phenotypic consequences of common genetic risk burden for epilepsies and their potential future clinical applications have not yet been determined. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) from a European-ancestry genome-wide association study in generalized and focal epilepsy, we quantified common genetic burden in patients with generalized epilepsy (GE-PRS) or focal epilepsy (FE-PRS) from two independent non-Finnish European cohorts (Epi25 Consortium, n = 5705; Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center, n = 620; both compared to 20 435 controls). One Finnish-ancestry population isolate (Finnish-ancestry Epi25, n = 449; compared to 1559 controls), two European-ancestry biobanks (UK Biobank, n = 383 656; Vanderbilt biorepository, n = 49 494), and one Japanese-ancestry biobank (BioBank Japan, n = 168 680) were used for additional replications. Across 8386 patients with epilepsy and 622 212 population controls, we found and replicated significantly higher GE-PRS in patients with generalized epilepsy of European-ancestry compared to patients with focal epilepsy (Epi25: P = 1.64$\times$10-15; Cleveland: P = 2.85$\times$10-4; Finnish-ancestry Epi25: P = 1.80$\times$10-4) or population controls (Epi25: P = 2.35$\times$10-70; Cleveland: P = 1.43$\times$10-7; Finnish-ancestry Epi25: P = 3.11$\times$10-4; UK Biobank and Vanderbilt biorepository meta-analysis: P = 7.99$\times$10-4). FE-PRS were significantly higher in patients with focal epilepsy compared to controls in the non-Finnish, non-biobank cohorts (Epi25: P = 5.74$\times$10-19; Cleveland: P = 1.69$\times$10-6). European ancestry-derived PRS did not predict generalized epilepsy or focal epilepsy in Japanese-ancestry individuals. Finally, we observed a significant 4.6-fold and a 4.5-fold enrichment of patients with generalized epilepsy compared to controls in the top 0.5\% highest GE-PRS of the two non-Finnish European cohorts (Epi25: P = 2.60$\times$10-15; Cleveland: P = 1.39$\times$10-2). We conclude that common variant risk associated with epilepsy is significantly enriched in multiple cohorts of patients with epilepsy compared to controls-in particular for generalized epilepsy. As sample sizes and PRS accuracy continue to increase with further common variant discovery, PRS could complement established clinical biomarkers and augment genetic testing for patient classification, comorbidity research, and potentially targeted treatment.},

abstract = {Elevated serum urate levels cause gout and correlate with cardiometabolic diseases via poorly understood mechanisms. We performed a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of serum urate in 457,690 individuals, identifying 183 loci (147 previously unknown) that improve the prediction of gout in an independent cohort of 334,880 individuals. Serum urate showed significant genetic correlations with many cardiometabolic traits, with genetic causality analyses supporting a substantial role for pleiotropy. Enrichment analysis, fine-mapping of urate-associated loci and colocalization with gene expression in 47 tissues implicated the kidney and liver as the main target organs and prioritized potentially causal genes and variants, including the transcriptional master regulators in the liver and kidney, HNF1A and HNF4A. Experimental validation showed that HNF4A transactivated the promoter of ABCG2, encoding a major urate transporter, in kidney cells, and that HNF4A p.Thr139Ile is a functional variant. Transcriptional coregulation within and across organs may be a general mechanism underlying the observed pleiotropy between urate and cardiometabolic traits.},

abstract = {Human height is a representative phenotype to elucidate genetic architecture. However, the majority of large studies have been performed in European population. To investigate the rare and low-frequency variants associated with height, we construct a reference panel (N = 3,541) for genotype imputation by integrating the whole-genome sequence data from 1,037 Japanese with that of the 1000 Genomes Project, and perform a genome-wide association study in 191,787 Japanese. We report 573 height-associated variants, including 22 rare and 42 low-frequency variants. These 64 variants explain 1.7\% of the phenotypic variance. Furthermore, a gene-based analysis identifies two genes with multiple height-increasing rare and low-frequency nonsynonymous variants (SLC27A3 and CYP26B1; PSKAT-O < 2.5 $\times$ 10-6). Our analysis shows a general tendency of the effect sizes of rare variants towards increasing height, which is contrary to findings among Europeans, suggesting that height-associated rare variants are under different selection pressure in Japanese and European populations.},

abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is responsible for a public health burden with multi-systemic complications. Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants. These results provide a comprehensive priority list of molecular targets for translational research.},

abstract = {Gout is a common arthritis caused by elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Here we investigated loci influencing SUA in a genome-wide meta-analysis with 121,745 Japanese subjects. We identified 8948 variants at 36 genomic loci (P<5 $\times$ 10-8) including eight novel loci. Of these, missense variants of SESN2 and PNPLA3 were predicted to be damaging to the function of these proteins; another five loci-TMEM18, TM4SF4, MXD3-LMAN2, PSORS1C1-PSORS1C2, and HNF4A-are related to cell metabolism, proliferation, or oxidative stress; and the remaining locus, LINC01578, is unknown. We also identified 132 correlated genes whose expression levels are associated with SUA-increasing alleles. These genes are enriched for the UniProt transport term, suggesting the importance of transport-related genes in SUA regulation. Furthermore, trans-ethnic meta-analysis across our own meta-analysis and the Global Urate Genetics Consortium has revealed 15 more novel loci associated with SUA. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of hyperuricemia/gout.},

abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are poised to improve biomedical outcomes via precision medicine. However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation of PRS is that those available today are several times more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric biases in genome-wide association studies, thus highlighting that-unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations-clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement for European-descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in leveling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date. To realize the full and equitable potential of PRS, greater diversity must be prioritized in genetic studies, and summary statistics must be publically disseminated to ensure that health disparities are not increased for those individuals already most underserved.},

abstract = {Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for a wide range of human diseases1. To investigate the genetic components associated with smoking behaviours in the Japanese population, we conducted a genome-wide association study of four smoking-related traits using up to 165,436 individuals. In total, we identified seven new loci, including three loci associated with the number of cigarettes per day (EPHX2-CLU, RET and CUX2-ALDH2), three loci associated with smoking initiation (DLC1, CXCL12-TMEM72-AS1 and GALR1-SALL3) and LINC01793-MIR4432HG, associated with the age of smoking initiation. Of these, three loci (LINC01793-MIR4432HG, CXCL12-TMEM72-AS1 and GALR1-SALL3) were found by conducting an additional sex-stratified genome-wide association study. This additional analysis showed heterogeneity of effects between sexes. The cross-sex linkage disequilibrium score regression2,3 analysis also indicated that the genetic component of smoking initiation was significantly different between the sexes. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis and trait-relevant tissue analysis showed that the number of cigarettes per day has a specific genetic background distinct from those of the other three smoking behaviours. We also report 11 diseases that share genetic basis with smoking behaviours. Although the current study should be carefully considered owing to the lack of replication samples, our findings characterized the genetic architecture of smoking behaviours. Further studies in East Asian populations are warranted to confirm our findings.},

Here, we report 26 loci (all P < 5 $\times$ 10-8) for reproductive ageing, i.e. puberty timing or age at menopause, in a non-European population (up to 67,029 women of Japanese ancestry). Highlighted genes for menopause include GNRH1, which supports a primary, rather than passive, role for hypothalamic-pituitary GnRH signalling in the timing of menopause. For puberty timing, we demonstrate an aetiological role for receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases by combining evidence across population genetics and pre- and peri-pubertal changes in hypothalamic gene expression in rodent and primate models. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate widespread differences in allele frequencies and effect estimates between Japanese and European associated variants, highlighting the benefits and challenges of large-scale trans-ethnic approaches.},

Using rare singletons, we identify signals of very recent selection for the past 2000-3000 years in multiple loci (ADH cluster, MHC region, BRAP-ALDH2, SERHL2). In large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset (n = 171,176), variants with selection signatures show enrichment in heterogeneity of derived allele frequency spectra among the geographic regions of Japan, highlighted by two major regional clusters (Hondo and Ryukyu). While the selection signatures do not show enrichment in archaic hominin-derived genome sequences, they overlap with the SNPs associated with the modern human traits. The strongest overlaps are observed for the alcohol or nutrition metabolism-related traits. Our study illustrates the value of high-depth WGS to understand evolution and their relationship with disease risk.},

abstract = {Stroke has multiple etiologies, but the underlying genes and pathways are largely unknown. We conducted a multiancestry genome-wide-association meta-analysis in 521,612 individuals (67,162 cases and 454,450 controls) and discovered 22 new stroke risk loci, bringing the total to 32. We further found shared genetic variation with related vascular traits, including blood pressure, cardiac traits, and venous thromboembolism, at individual loci (n = 18), and using genetic risk scores and linkage-disequilibrium-score regression. Several loci exhibited distinct association and pleiotropy patterns for etiological stroke subtypes. Eleven new susceptibility loci indicate mechanisms not previously implicated in stroke pathophysiology, with prioritization of risk variants and genes accomplished through bioinformatics analyses using extensive functional datasets. Stroke risk loci were significantly enriched in drug targets for antithrombotic therapy.},

abstract = {Clinical measurements can be viewed as useful intermediate phenotypes to promote understanding of complex human diseases. To acquire comprehensive insights into the underlying genetics, here we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 58 quantitative traits in 162,255 Japanese individuals. Overall, we identified 1,407 trait-associated loci (P < 5.0 $\times$ 10-8), 679 of which were novel. By incorporating 32 additional GWAS results for complex diseases and traits in Japanese individuals, we further highlighted pleiotropy, genetic correlations, and cell-type specificity across quantitative traits and diseases, which substantially expands the current understanding of the associated genetics and biology. This study identified both shared polygenic effects and cell-type specificity, represented by the genetic links among clinical measurements, complex diseases, and relevant cell types. Our findings demonstrate that even without prior biological knowledge of cross-phenotype relationships, genetics corresponding to clinical measurements successfully recapture those measurements' relevance to diseases, and thus can contribute to the elucidation of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) is an autoimmune disease of skin and joints with heterogeneity in epidemiologic and genetic landscapes of global populations. We conducted an initial genome-wide association study and a replication study of PsV in the Japanese population (606 PsV cases and 2,052 controls). We identified significant associations of the single nucleotide polymorphisms with PsV risk at TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1and the major histocompatibility complex region (P = 3.7 $\times$ 10-10 and 6.6 $\times$ 10-15, respectively). By updating the HLA imputation reference panel of Japanese (n = 908) to expand HLA gene coverage, we fine-mapped the HLA variants associated with PsV risk. Although we confirmed the PsV risk of HLA-C*06:02 (odds ratio = 6.36, P = 0.0015), its impact was relatively small compared with those in other populations due to rare allele frequency in Japanese (0.4\% in controls). Alternatively, HLA-A*02:07, which corresponds to the cysteine residue at HLA-A amino acid position 99 (HLA-A Cys99), demonstrated the most significant association with PsV (odds ratio = 4.61, P = 1.2 $\times$ 10-10). In addition to HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-C*06:02, stepwise conditional analysis identified an independent PsV risk of HLA-DQ$\beta$1 Asp57 (odds ratio = 2.19, P = 1.9 $\times$ 10-6). Our PsV genome-wide association study in Japanese highlighted the genetic architecture of PsV, including the identification of HLA risk variants.},

In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of body mass index (BMI) in Japanese people (n = 173,430), we found 85 loci significantly associated with obesity (P < 5.0 $\times$ 10-8), of which 51 were previously unknown. We conducted trans-ancestral meta-analyses by integrating these results with the results from a GWAS of Europeans and identified 61 additional new loci. In total, this study identifies 112 novel loci, doubling the number of previously known BMI-associated loci. By annotating associated variants with cell-type-specific regulatory marks, we found enrichment of variants in CD19+ cells. We also found significant genetic correlations between BMI and lymphocyte count (P = 6.46 $\times$ 10-5, rg = 0.18) and between BMI and multiple complex diseases. These findings provide genetic evidence that lymphocytes are relevant to body weight regulation and offer insights into the pathogenesis of obesity.},

abstract = {Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) is characterized by rapid alveolar bone destruction and tooth loss early in life, and its etiology remains unclear. To explore the genetic risk factors of AgP, we performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping for identity-by-descent mapping and identified 32 distinct candidate loci, followed by whole exome sequencing with 2 pedigrees of AgP consisting of 3 cases and 1 control in 1 family and 2 sibling cases in the other. After variant filtering procedures and validation by targeted Sanger sequencing, we identified 2 missense mutations at 16q12 in NOD2 (p.Ala110Thr and p.Arg311Trp), which encodes nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2. We further examined 94 genetically unrelated AgP patients by targeted sequencing of NOD2 and found that 2 patients among them also carried the p.Arg311Trp variant. Furthermore, we found 3 additional missense mutations in this gene (p.His370Tyr, p.Arg459Cys, and p.Ala868Thr). These mutations either had not been previously observed or are extremely rare (frequency <0.001) in Asian populations. NOD2 plays a crucial role in innate immunity as an intracellular receptor initiating nuclear factor $\kappa$B-dependent and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent gene transcription. These results demonstrated NOD2 as a novel gene involved in AgP.},

abstract = {Despite the progress in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) causal variant mapping, independent localization of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) risk from classical HLA genes is challenging. Here, we conducted a large-scale MHC fine-mapping analysis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Japanese population (6,244 RA cases and 23,731 controls) population by using HLA imputation, followed by a multi-ethnic validation study including east Asian and European populations (n = 7,097 and 23,149, respectively). Our study identified an independent risk of a synonymous mutation at HLA-DOA, a non-classical HLA gene, on anti-citrullinated protein autoantibody (ACPA)-positive RA risk (p = 1.4 $\times$ 10(-9)), which demonstrated a cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) effect on HLA-DOA expression. Trans-ethnic comparison revealed different linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in HLA-DOA and HLA-DRB1, explaining the observed HLA-DOA variant risk heterogeneity among ethnicities, which was most evident in the Japanese population. Although previous HLA fine-mapping studies have identified amino acid polymorphisms of the classical HLA genes as driving genetic susceptibility to disease, our study additionally identifies the dosage contribution of a non-classical HLA gene to disease etiology. Our study contributes to the understanding of HLA immunology in human diseases and suggests the value of incorporating additional ancestry in MHC fine-mapping.},

abstract = {To assess the statistical significance of associations between variants and traits, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) should employ an appropriate threshold that accounts for the massive burden of multiple testing in the study. Although most studies in the current literature commonly set a genome-wide significance threshold at the level of P=5.0 $\times$ 10-8, the adequacy of this value for respective populations has not been fully investigated. To empirically estimate thresholds for different ancestral populations, we conducted GWAS simulations using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data set for Africans (AFR), Europeans (EUR), Admixed Americans (AMR), East Asians (EAS) and South Asians (SAS). The estimated empirical genome-wide significance thresholds were Psig=3.24 $\times$ 10-8 (AFR), 9.26 $\times$ 10-8 (EUR), 1.83 $\times$ 10-7 (AMR), 1.61 $\times$ 10-7 (EAS) and 9.46 $\times$ 10-8 (SAS). We additionally conducted trans-ethnic meta-analyses across all populations (ALL) and all populations except for AFR ($\Delta$AFR), which yielded Psig=3.25 $\times$ 10-8 (ALL) and 4.20 $\times$ 10-8 ($\Delta$AFR). Our results indicate that the current threshold (P=5.0 $\times$ 10-8) is overly stringent for all ancestral populations except for Africans; however, we should employ a more stringent threshold when conducting a meta-analysis, regardless of the presence of African samples.},

We applied the method to the GWAS results of the 18 human complex traits from >1.75 million subjects, and identified significant enrichment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), kidney function, and adult height (P < 0.05/18 = 0.0028, most significant enrichment in RA with P = 1.7 $\times$ 10(-4)). Interestingly, these results were consistent with current literature-based knowledge of the traits on miRNA obtained through the NCBI PubMed database search (adjusted P = 0.024). Our method provided a list of miRNA and target gene pairs with excess genetic association signals, part of which included drug target genes. We identified a miRNA (miR-4728-5p) that downregulates PADI2, a novel RA risk gene considered as a promising therapeutic target (rs761426, adjusted P = 2.3 $\times$ 10(-9)). Our study indicated the significant impact of miRNA-target gene networks on the genetics of human complex traits, and provided resources which should contribute to drug discovery and nucleic acid medicine.},
